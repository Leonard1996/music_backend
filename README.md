# Archicture and functionalities

    Services included are nodejs backend running express server on typescript and TypeOrm for db interactions, redis instance caching all suggestions and is populated asynchronously everytime a new search is made, mysql server as persistance layer having 3 tables (users, searchHistory, favorites).

    Most of api's are self explanatory, with the most complex being 'GET http://localhost:3001/songs?keyword=', as the result given back depends on favorites of the user, a weight is assigned to each song and the songs retrieved from the api are then ordered according to this weight.
